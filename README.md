# XYZ
Designed the layout of a website prototype surrounding the idea of a “smart home”.

It allows the user to see an overview of the energy/security status of the house and control components such as door locks and lighting over the Internet.

Had no prior practical experience in using HTML/CSS/JavaScript before this assignment.
